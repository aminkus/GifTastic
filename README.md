# GifTastic
This project entailed using the Giphy API as well as Jquery to dynamically generate buttons based on user input. The user would input an animal of thier choice and a button would be created that was conected to an AJAX call to the Giphy API. JQuery woudld then create new elements to display 10 Gifs onto the DOM.
